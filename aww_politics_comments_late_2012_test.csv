4051,"c7iupiw","politics","&gt; And the fact you are trying to restrict my rights over the death of 20 people is disturbing. Less than 1.5% of total non suicide gun deaths in the country.

The point is that it's not 20 children.  It's tens of thousands of people.  But the 20 kids mentioned had nothing to do with the first amendment.

The first amendment is far more fundamental than the fringe cases of the second amendment.  It's a philosophical question.  And the question of how many people can acceptably die to keep it in place is a result of the how many people some opposing force will kill if it exists.  The difference between ""The right to own any goddamn gun I see fit"" is different than ""the right to own a reasonable weapon, or a reasonable number of weapons"".  

For the whole 2nd amendment (the right to own a gun at all), the value would be the nexus of the line where more access to weapons leads to greater death and the line of less access to guns leading to greater death at another man's hand.  The 2nd amendment is unique in that its topic is directly related to the number of people who do or don't die as a result of gun violence, lack of self-defense, or suicide.  Right now it looks like the marginal cost of increased gun control would not likely be significant, while the marginal value of increased control would be greater than that cost.  How many people will die for lack of self-defense if the gun-show loophole is closed and all people must undergo a background check, or if magazine sizes are reduced?  How many people will live as a result of fewer guns floating owned by negligent people or purchased through straw dealers?  If the result of these increased laws is to decrease the number of deaths relative to no increase in law, then you would have to argue that the right to own more guns, larger clips, buy guns with less waiting time is more valuable than the lives that are lost as a result of these remaining freedoms.

Do you truly believe that access to 30-round clips, access to weapons cited in the so-called semi-automatic assault-weapons bans, requiring waiting periods, and the like will increase fatalities.  If not, do you truly believe that these rights (which go above and beyond the right to self-defense) are as valuable as the lives that they cost?

Nobody's talking about repealing the 2nd amendment, only tempering it as all the other amendments are, from time to time, tempered.  We have libel laws, the FCC, and other forms of censorship, and we find those to be prudent, even though we have the 1st amendment.  We have the right to assemble, but only peacefully.  In the same way, we have gun control laws, even though we have the 2nd amendment.",1,"microsoftcoreporn",1355885737,0,1,"t3_151tw7","c7iskoa","False","Did you entirely miss the point of the conversation?

(5th) Maybe its having to serve on a jury. (6, 7) Either way there is a cost to your rights, and rare gun violence is a price I am willing to pay. The lives of 20 people are worth any right. And the fact you are trying to restrict my rights over the death of 20 people is disturbing. Less than 1.5% of total non suicide gun deaths in the country. 

So, where does your line lay, where are you willing to draw the line in the sand? When will you give up your rights? How many deaths would it take for you to give up your 4th amendment right? 1000? 5000? 10000? That's my argument. Why should the death of 20 people reduce my rights?","c7iskoa"

The Bible is full of similar harsh laws if you’re looking for them.[1] However, the application of such Biblical and Qur’anic injunctions is not to be outside of due process of law, in a place or land where such law is accepted and applied by the society as a whole.

So this is the crux of the argument.  He says he doesn't support the fatwah *per se*, but he *does* want Salman Rushdie to stand trial for a capital offense in a muslim country.

Gee, I wonder what the result of such a trial should be?

Everything else is dancing around the issue.  He wants someone murdered for ""blasphemy"".",26,"rocketvat",1355179164,0,26,"t3_14lw4k","c7ee8gb","False","Lets get some information from the man himself. On Yusuf Islam's website he has a FAQ where in he addresses this Rushdie issue. 
&gt;I never called for the death of Salman Rushdie; nor backed the Fatwa issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini – and still don’t. The book itself destroyed the harmony between peoples and created an unnecessary international crisis.

&gt;When asked about my opinion regarding blasphemy, I could not tell a lie and confirmed that – like both the Torah and the Gospel – the Qur’an considers it, without repentance, as a capital offense. The Bible is full of similar harsh laws if you’re looking for them.[1] However, the application of such Biblical and Qur’anic injunctions is not to be outside of due process of law, in a place or land where such law is accepted and applied by the society as a whole.

&gt;The accusation that I supported the Fatwa, therefore, is wholly false and misleading. It was due to my naivety in trying to answer a loaded question posed by a journalist, after a harmless biographical lecture I gave to students in Kingston University in 1989, which unleashed the infamous headline above.

&gt;To indicate my actual stance about this matter before this front-page controversy erupted, it’s useful to quote a letter of complaint I sent to Viking, a subsidiary of Penguin Books, the publishers, on 8th October, 1989. This was after I had been sent a preview of the text of Satanic Verses:

&gt;I wish to express my deepest outrage at the insensitivity of Penguin Books in Publishing Salman Rushdie’s book, Satanic Verses, This book is clearly blasphemous in nature and so deeply offensive to the Muslim Community I urge you to give the contents of this letter your most urgent attention and take a responsible decision.

&gt;As can be seen from the above, my personal response before the heat-seeking media got involved was significantly different from the fables and myths which have been circulated.

&gt;Sad that no matter how many times I’ve repeatedly tried to explain my true position, journalists inevitably bring up this subject again and again; as if it was the only memorable thing I was reported to have done in my sixty-odd years living on this planet (yawn).

&gt;[1] In Exodus 20:7 the Third Commandment openly states, “You shall not take the name of The Lord in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless.”

&gt;It also says in Leviticus 24:16, “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregations shall surely stone him.”

&gt;Again, quoting Matthew, 12: 31-32, Jesus is reported to have said, “Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit, shall not be forgiven.”

&gt;In addition regarding other crimes it says in Leviticus 20: 14,“And if a man take a wife and her mother he shall be burnt with fire“.

&gt;Also in Leviticus 20: 15, “if a man lies with a beast, he shall surely be put to death,” and in Exodus 21:17, “Anyone who curses his father and mother must be put to death.”

California's medical marijuana legislation has become a stalking horse for the legalization effort. Thus, it's a ""side door.""

While waiting on full legalization, many thousands have (probably fraudulently) become medical marijuana users. Indeed, [it's well-known that California's model for medical marijuana is flaunted and abused](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/us/california-fight-to-ensure-marijuana-goes-only-to-sick.html) as a pretext to get a med card based on flimsy need. 

I personally know several non-need based smokers there and I've been to California once in my life, for one week two years ago.

Consequently, in my state the implementation of medical marijuana has been beset by foot-dragging and hand-wringing to put up more safeguards against this abuse. So, the net effect of California's high profile abuse of medical marijuana laws is that non-Californians elsewhere in the country are still waiting for their medical marijuana.

As to Nevada, in 2005 or 2006 the voters went 55/45 against full legalization, and that was before the success of the Marijuana Policy Project in Colorado and Washington. The state has already decriminalized personal use and has medical marijuana. IMO, full legalization is not far behind. In a state that loves liberty - gambling, prostitution, etc - as much as Nevada, that seems like a fair guess.",3,"libertyindeath",1353450003,0,3,"t3_13ia8q","c749t6b","False","&gt;California got there through the side-door.

Just because I choose to eat a steak doesn't mean that it is highly unlikely that I would have eaten a ham sandwich if I didn't have the steak.  I had the choice to eat the ham sandwich anyway, but the steak was more appealing, so I choose that.

In a similar way, someone who is motivated to commit a murder will choose the most desirable method readily available to them, but if that method was not available they might simply have chosen the next most desirable method, rather than not commit the murder at all.  His fists probably wouldn't have been the next most desirable method, I used that example to demonstrate that you cannot divorce a person from the means to kill others, especially an athlete like this.

Your ignorance assumes that I only see the negative effects of illegal immigration. That is not true. I understand that while illegally living here they have to consume goods and services that are taxed, and that tax goes to pay for governmental needs. I recognize that, but I see those few positives don't out weigh the negatives. Simply adding to the economy and paying taxes does not give you a pass to skip to the head of the line and become a citizen. The negatives outweigh the positives, that's why we have immigration laws.

&gt;Now to address why your sentiments are in fact racist...

""it's a fact that the majority of [illegal aliens] are Hispanic."" Is it reasonable to suspect that a person that looks like they may be from mexico and sounds like they are from Mexico may actually be from Mexico? Of course it's reasonable to have a suspicion. Is it also reasonable that the same person may be a US citizen? Yes that is also reasonable. That's also why race is not the sole factor in the law.

&gt;It is well known in AZ that Arpaio targets Hispanic neighborhoods for his raids.

Why not? If it's ""a fact that the majority of [illegal aliens] are Hispanic"" why wouldn't you go where the illegal aliens live?

How do you enforce our immigration laws in AZ were ""the majority of [illegal aliens] are Hispanic"" and not have race be a factor in the profiling of suspected illegal aliens when the majority come from a particular race? I can admit the is a racial component to majority of illegal aliens but is dealing with it racist? How do you enforce our laws and have it not be racist?",1,"Occupy_RULES6",1351803681,0,1,"t3_12eovs","c6urjvk","False","As you can see, I referred to your comment as ignorant as well as racist. I'll address the ignorance first.  To say that non citizens are ""sponging parasites"" shows not only a distinct lack of couth, but shows your misunderstanding of how these people contribute to the economy. 1) They pay taxes. Granted, many use false social security numbers to obtain employment, but they end up paying taxes for services they will never gain any benefit from (i.e. social security).  The AP Reported that ""In 2003 alone, the government received Social Security taxes on $57.8 billion from wage reports that couldn’t be matched to the person filing."" 2) They also pay sales tax.  3) They contribute to the economy through rent/mortgage payments.  4) They purchase goods like any citizen does which help the local economy. 5) They contribute to the economy and society in many unseen and intangible ways much like you and I do. 

Now to address why your sentiments are in fact racist.  This thread is about an AZ sheriff. Well here in AZ, it's a fact that the majority of undocumented non citizens are Hispanic, so to play the ""White, Black and Asian"" angle when discussing Arpaio is disingenuous at best.  Arpaio has never publicly made it his business to go after anyone who isn't Hispanic. He was/is a huge supporter of the ""show me your papers"" law which requires law enforcement to ask for ID if they suspect someone is here illegally.  The MAIN way to have your suspicion aroused is either by skin color or accent.  It is well known in AZ that Arpaio targets Hispanic neighborhoods for his raids.  He's hateful, racist, and needs to go.  I don't want to lump you in with him because you're obviously someone who cares deeply about your beliefs, but you did choose to defend him.

Five people are dead after a gunman opened fire on a Native American reservation in Central California. Hector Celaya killed his mother, her two brothers and his eight-year-old daughter Alyssa. He also wounded Alyssa’s brother and sister. Celaya was attempting to flee with his two daughters when he was fatally injured in a shootout with police early Sunday.

3338,"c78ppol","politics","For those that didn't open the pdf, the abstract: 

&gt; Seven studies using experimental and naturalistic methods reveal
that upper-class individuals behave more unethically than lowerclass
individuals. In studies 1 and 2, upper-class individuals were
more likely to break the law while driving, relative to lower-class
individuals. In follow-up laboratory studies, upper-class individuals
were more likely to exhibit unethical decision-making tendencies
(study 3), take valued goods from others (study 4), lie in a negotiation
(study 5), cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize (study 6),
and endorse unethical behavior at work (study 7) than were lowerclass
individuals. Mediator and moderator data demonstrated that
upper-class individuals’ unethical tendencies are accounted for, in
part, by their more favorable attitudes toward greed.

So in tl;dr format, upper-class individuals were more likely to do the following, relative to lower-class individuals: 

* break the law while driving (and presumably other times when they think the odds of getting away with it are in their favor)

* exhibit unethical decision-making tendencies

* lie in a negotiation

* cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize

* take valued goods from others (steal)

* endorse unethical behavior at work

* have a more favorable attitude toward greed

I'd be interested to see a long-term study following people over several decades (starting at age 21), looking at the behavior above and seeing what socio-economic class they wind up in over time. My sense is that the above bulletpoints are how the rich became rich and what keeps the not-rich from becoming rich, but it would be good to have research demonstrating it. 

EDIT: An important caveat in that is to not assume increasing wholesomeness as one goes down the socio-economic ladder to the bottom; desperation in an environment of poverty has similar reward mechanisms as  greed in an environment of opportunity. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that ethical behavior among the classes is on a bell curve, with the low points on the highest and lowest ends, although I'm not sure the highest point of the curve is in the middle of the middle class.

Christie's decision will only add to questions among Republicans about what the governor -- who is up for reelection a year from now -- is thinking, and why he went out of his way to heap praise on the president, and then refused to appear with Romney.

The Romney rally was held at a farm in Morrisville, Pa., not more than 20 minutes from Trenton, the New Jersey capital. The physical proximity of the event to New Jersey only added to questions in the Romney campaign about why Christie chose not to come.

See, *I* know what that means, I know who those people are and what the movement stood for. But *I* am not everyone, and there are people posting right now on my FB feed asking what the difference between Liberals and Libertarians is. We live in a nation where it is *safe* to assume that someone is an idiot until they prove otherwise, so yes, for your sake a better analogy IS Jim Crow and the Segregationists. But for the vast majority of people, they don't know what those words mean. They DO know what Nazis were though, and most people know that Hitler gained power legitimately through saving Germany's economy (this is assuming they've gone through public school, and given that red states are the ones most often found in the news for neglecting to teach kids about things like slavery/segregation it seems unlikely they'd know about Jim Crow, but Americans have a borderline creepy obsession with WW2 and the Nazis so I think it's a safer bet) and that many of his supporters were either unaware or unsupportive of concentration camps and the like, so they know that a person might call themselves a Nazi back then without realizing all the horrible things their party was doing.


I am not saying the GOP is as bad as the nazis, that would require me to drop at least twelve tabs of LSD to believe. I am saying that, like the Nazis and their cult of personality that attracted so many German supporters by using strong nationalism and cultural identity propaganda, yet were guilty of doing things and supporting ideals which their followers would have been horrified by if they knew about it and understood it, the Republican Party is a cult of personality whose supporters often don't know or even understand what it is the GOP is doing, and yet they still call themselves members of the party. Those who *do* know and understand what the GOP actually stands for today are evil, or crazy, just like those members of the Nazi party who *did* know and understand what Hitler was really doing but didn't stop him were either evil, or crazy.

Basically I'm saying that a huge number of people who call themselves Republican because it was the party of their father do not understand what the Republican party has become, and they are blindly supporting the party's rise to power without realizing the intentions of the party leadership no longer match up with what they, the voters, actually want.",1,"R_Jeeves",1352246487,0,1,"t3_12qap9","c6xh1zg","False","The metaphor/analogy is still a terrible one.

Still a comparison to the Nazis is unwarranted. There have been plenty of more relevant examples, the one that resonates for me are the Segregationists and Jim Crow. 

What is disgraceful about trying to tie the current republican party to the nazis (other than the gross hyperbole, http://i.imgur.com/4mzoe.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/Kegft.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/XBq72.jpg  )is it ties us all to them.

Furthermore, they make a product with thin margins and have less automation then their competitors. Considering increases in food prices and consumers demands for healthier snacks... it isn't surprising they had problems. 

Literally, the only saving grace of the company would be a major restructuring... something that would involve a massive amount of capital from new investors.

&gt;Let's call a spade a spade, and not everything we don't like ""capitalism.""

I have issue with calling a centrally planned/managed economy (at least from a monetary view) ""capitalism"" when it doesn't work as expected\intended.

Also, I have problem with calling it a ""lack of regulation"" as the regulators specifically chose not to act.  In that case, the ""lack of regulation"" was really a failure of regulation.  The regulators held hearings and debated about whether derivatives should be regulated or not, and they decided that derivatives shouldn't be regulated.  The regulators existed, the regulatory structure existed, yet it independently decided (with influence of course) to not regulate.  I will make it very clear, that I do not believe in unregulated markets but I also don't believe in a regulatory system that has been captured by those it is supposed to regulate.  

Also, part of those loose lending standards originated from the Fed's FOMC pushing down rates and inflating the housing bubble to temporarily alleviate pain of the dot com bubble.  The very same FOMC whose head was one of the loudest and most influential voices pushing/convincing regulators to not regulate derivatives.  

Note: I am trying to merely focus on what was and is (not ""capitalism"", not ""unregulated"").  I have attempted to restrain my opinion on what should have been or should be, in an attempt to not cloud the purpose of my post.

Both of these factors are instances of failed central planning as it relates to monetary policy and regulation.  Yet people try to pretend it's ""capitalism"" and that bothers me.  We will not come up with solutions when we cannot even get the history and language right.  Calling this central planning failure ""capitalism,"" implies that introducing some central planning and regulations will fix the problem.  We had both prior to the problem, and both played key roles in the problem.  I will reiterate that I am not advocating against the concept of central planning regulations or capitalism, I am simply attempting to set the record straight without political bias.

If it's the first option I question if you know what would have happened if we had not had the Fed's quantitative easing programs, had let those banks fail, and let Greece exit the Eurozone. If it's the second option I think there's an argument to be made, in the US at least, that it was the lack of regulation in derivatives trading which gave banks incentive to loosen lending standards which was the first domino in this whole mess. 

Granted, one domino does not cause a disaster, there were other lingering weaknesses in the economy which were a combination of too much regulation in some areas and not enough in others that made the whole thing snowball.

I think pretty much exactly the way you do, except that I do think the so-called poor treatment of the palestinians by the israelis is widely exaggerated. People mistake israel wanting to check shipments for weapons as them trying to somehow restrict the palestinian people, when in reality they're really just trying to prevent Hamas terrorists from getting more guns.

As for the settlements though, and Netanyahu, we're in complete agreement. The settlement building disgusts me, makes me ashamed of the Israelis because they're letting themselves get blackmailed by ultra orthodox extremists. Netanyahu is both weak on extremists and too strong on war. It is to be somewhat expected, these members of hte israeli old guard grew up in wars, they're battle hardened, weary and don't really know any other life. That does not mean their actions are okay, of course. 

I also could not agree more about Palestine needing to oust Hamas.

I don't think anyone rational will tell you Israeli don't have a right to exist but that doesn't excuse some of its policies. I think Israeli's should vote out Netanyahu and find someone who is willing to find a solution, recognise that the treatment of the Palestinians cannot continue and ask the Palestinian people to not vote in people who fire rockets onto innocent people.

Moreover, the CDC examined research preformed by outside sources. Therefore, for each of the studies they looked at they found inconclusive evidence, as some studies indicated decreased violence, while others indicated increased. 

This, unfortunately, means that you cant use the CDC to make a case, as their basically saying they don't have conclusive evidence to credibly link - or NOT LINK - gun control laws to a reduction in violent crime, suicide, or accidents.

Researchers could not identify a single regulation that reduced violent crime, suicide or accidents. A year earlier, the Centers for Disease Control reported on ammunition bans, restrictions on acquisition, waiting periods, registration, licensing, child access prevention and zero tolerance laws. CDC's conclusion: There was no conclusive evidence that the laws reduced gun violence.

One station A. is located on the northbound Main st. and the other is station B. is located on southbound. Station A. is an easy right in right out convenient store with 4 pumps and regular size c-store... but is a complete mess it's pumps are dirty it's bathroom is the depths of hell the floor is sticky. While Station B. is a pain to access I have to make a left in to get to the store, fight traffic getting back on my way to work but is spotless and clean and well lit and has employees in nice new uniforms with smiles on their faces. You know what station A. has 700 people go through it a day and station B. only has 100 customers per day, so of course station A. will look worse for wear than station B. But to get volume it could be all about the price of what you charge out front. If the local market is selling gas at $3.50 a gallon, i.e. on average out of 10 stations selling gas in my suburban town the average is 3.50. So if station A. sells at 3.50 he can expect to sell 100k gallons a month. Well if station A. sells at $3.45 he can sell 150k a month, now he's losing .05c a gallon but increasing his sales by 50% so if he was making 17C on the gallon he makes $17k for the month selling at market price but if he drops his price he only make 12c but sells 150k he makes $18k a month that increases his sales $1k a month. Or on the flipside he can sell his gas at $3.55 he can only sell 80k a month but now he is making .23c a gallon on 80k he makes $18,400 a month. But say he tries to sell at 3.57 well that's just too much of a difference for the customer and now he only sells 50k a month well he is making a .25c a gallon but for the month he only makes $12,500 well that just really sucks.

Because they can as stated purchase the gas months in advance at a locked in rate, for example it's November and a barrel of oil/gas costs $110 so I think over the next 6 months crude will stay average to $110 and below so I purchase 600k gallons. Now my competitor may only purchase 3 months worth (300k)at $110 now and in 3 months gas is now $90 dollars a barrel and he purchases the last 3 months at $90 a barrel (or the price could be $150, but we'll keep this simple). Well that leaves the original owner in quite a pickle doesn't it because he is trying to sell gas as $110 while the competitor is getting it at $90, but the competitor is trying to make as much money as possible, so he will sell the gas at $105 making a $15 profit. Now multiply this by the 15 or so gas station you find within a 2 mile radius and also factor in large pumpers who always sell at a lower margin such as Wawa/racetrac/walmart and you see that it becomes almost a game of chicken the guy purchasing at a lower price could slaughter the competition but not make much money so he keeps his prices towards the average to make the most profit. Just look on average how much a barrel of oil fluctuates throughout the year (http://www.oil-price.net/) and you will see why it varies greatly at the pump.

About the top US hospital it writes: *John Hopkins is a nonprofit organization that has been ranked number one in the nation for 19 consecutive years [...]. They receive more federal funding than most other U.S. Medical Schools.*

That second sentence there is very interesting I think: the excellence in providing care is not solely driven by the current private medical insurance system - it's already tax supported. 

Now that ranking is far from universally accepted - e.g. this list http://www.mtqua.org/providers/top-10-worlds-best-hospitals-for-medical-tourists-list/ places 6 other international hospitals above the one in Thailand topping the previous list. (And no US hospitals for obvious reasons.)

Why it's not a worm:  Tape worms don't make it there.  Heart worms take 6 months to develop, so they can't exist in puppies.

Whether this constitutes a better version of society is entirely up for debate, but it's misleading for progressives to pretend freedom is what they value most: the term ""liberal"" has been misappropriated in this instance.

It most certainly is a critique of Capitalism as you've quite rightly observed, but you are incorrect to assume that Globalisation, if by that we're talking about restructuring production and manufacturing systems across borders to avail of cheaper access to raw materials and labour, that this system is an independant concept that is 'seperate and distinct' from the Capitalist mode of production. The concept of Globalisation cannot be isolated from Capitalism - unless you wish to talk about some form of international socialism which is an entirely different concept.

It's entirely possible that I'm a complete idiot, but I fail to understand what you mean by *further victimised*. Are you attempting to understand which is more unpleasant for an uneducated Chinese person, being forced to participate in feudal-esque subsistance farming, or forced to participate in capitalist exploitation?

For what it's worth, I didn't offer any attempt to quantify the rate of victimisation, generalise or suggest that certain parties are *further victimised* by globalisation than they would be living under conditions of subsistence farming, but more often than not, subsistence farmers don't make up the backbone of those who are forced into unskilled labour in urban areas. It is usually the small farmers who depend on single crops that are forced to migrate *en masse* to urban areas after trade barriers are lifted, or markets are flooded with subsidised goods from 1st world countries, who are then forced to sell themselves at *subsistence wage levels* without any social safety net. 

These are the people that you might argue are ""further victimised"" by Globalisation. ",1,"Pungenday",1353711322,0,1,"t3_13na2r","c75pz0r","False","&gt;The answer to the last question should be clear, looking at it through the above lens.

Not to be short, but your response is a critique of Capitalism, which can include Globalization but is also separate and distinct. Whether or not the job is outsourced exploitation, in the Marxist sense, exists so long as capital is privately owned and wage labor employed. I see the point that you are making - that all the laborers are victims, however this is not instructive when isolating Globalization and looking at that concept by itself.

To rephrase my question, which parties are *further victimized* by Globalization than they were already. A subsistence farmer in rural China is not being exploited if he works his own land and ekes out enough to survive. He *is* being exploited if he goes to work in a factory where the wage he is paid is far less than the retail price of his produce. However in the absence of globalization the choice he makes does not exist. Given the current capitalist paradigm, is the farmer further victimized by the presence of this choice?

We can sign the shit out of international treaties - we could have signed the Kyoto Protocol - and there are almost no realistic consequences for not following through on the letter of those treaties.

The faculty in these clinics are understaffed, overworked and underfunded and lots of people _are_ falling through the cracks as a result. One of the patients I remember speaking to was a very shy polite man in his early 20s who was according to himself prone to violent psychotic episodes, he described a very strict lonely childhood not unlike Adam Lanza's, after one particularly violent episode he was kicked out by his parents, after applying for help and jumping through the hoops he was more or less sent away to a homeless shelter due to lack of available resources.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most gun control advocates aren't in favor of completely banning guns.  There's certainly a case for recreational hunting and home security (although, to be honest, there's more than one way to scare off a burglar; in fact, there's nothing stopping a burglar from owning a firearm and shooting you first before you get to your own gun).  

That said, having some more protections and MUCH stiffer penalties for illegal ownership of firearms is definitely worth the shot.  I mean, for crying out, this guy was using a licensed M4.  That's more than overkill here, and beyond the scope of ""personal protection.""  I would go so far as to say that people that are found to have mental instabilities should NOT be around guns (perhaps banning this in families of these sorts of cases?).

In fact, given what has happened in the past several years, that the weapons obtained in similar tragedies have all been legal and almost all have been from people that have had mental health issues of one sort or another, and which have ALL been documented so.

And any argument of the intent of America's forefathers is ridiculous and completely idiotic without context.  That during the American Revolution and the signing of the Constitution, America did not have a full standing army.  That Americans that were fighting were in trained militias.

18842,"c6ztk39","politics","The effective corporate tax rate in the USA for businesses making &lt;$5 million/yr (small business as defined by the IRS) is 37%

Hell, Wal-mart paid 33.8% last year alone.  Using multinationals in your number does not work, as you are counting their foreign sourced income as US sourced which is not even TAXED in Canada at any percentage.

This is again, rewriting the rules to benefit your argument, and doesn't even relate to the real numbers.
http://www.savingtoinvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/2011-Corporate-Tax-Rates.png

No, 1% of corporate taxes as GDP is because EVERY small business chooses the s-corp structure (which shows up as personal income tax) until they make at least 20-30 million/yr in revenue.  This is why our rate is so low now, when it used to not be that low. 

Because Wal-mart has very limited foreign income, it pays 33.8% (in 2011), so you still have no clue what you're talking about.  Selecting Norway just kind of makes you a retard as well, as most of their money is from oil.

Average for small business S-corps is 27% (mostly because they aren't probably pulling in more than a few hundred thousand in profit and these numbers aren't even factoring in their FICA taxes)

http://www.washingtonpolicy.org/blog/post/federal-effective-tax-rates-average-20-small-businesses

It's great that you think total aggregate taxes paid is what matters and toss in every F50 company (whose net profit outstrips 90% of all small businesses added together) and call it a day, but my entire point is that SMALL BUSINESSES are the ones that WILL SUFFER.  And small businesses (less than 5 million/yr) are the major source for new jobs... with 70% month to month being created there.  

http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/31/us/embed-america-murdock-minnesota/index.html

Get it now? What we need (if you want to fix this) is tax reform that levels this field completely between multinationals and the small guy, lowers the actual US rate so people stay compliant and don't shift trillions (1.8 trillion at this point) overseas, and maybe actually really really cut some major breaks to small businesses (for instance, stop bloody auditing SPs so much)
Just so you know, the Canadian effective corporate rate is 16.5% as of this year.

And no, Romney did not pay an effective rate of 13% because of any of this.  He took out DIVIDENDS from his company (which had already paid US tax on all of their income, which was ~30% that year if I recall)
So Romney's tax rate? It's actually ~ 45% when you toss how much Bain paid, and the fact he was doubled taxed on it.  Because Bain buys US companies, they cannot, under any circumstances, not pay US tax on that income.  It's called the real property exclusion (check out Section 26 of the US code) and it instantly makes all of Bain's income US source.

It's not a loophole in fact, if his company was an S-corp he would have possibly paid less overall tax and brought home more money, it just would have been on his 1040 so you could rest easy knowing he paid ~40% in tax himself",1,"jonesrr",1352667001,0,1,"t3_130dtz","c6ztb4j","1352668020","Why don't you look at *effective* corporate tax rates in the US instead? Our tax code is ridden with loopholes, deductions and giveaways. Our *effective* tax rate is more around 13% with all these things factored in, versus Canada's 14-15%. We're on the low end of the scale. Germany wins the cake with 7%. On the flip side of it, UK has it at around 27% and Australia around 30%. Just to drive the point home about how low our effective rates are, we get only about 2% of our revenue from corporate taxes in the US. Canada's effective tax rate is similar to ours and they too make about 2% of their total revenue from the same source. By contrast, Norway makes about 8% of its revenue from taxing its corporations.

You can go and do your research on this yourself. I don't expect you to believe me until you dig it up yourself. It's entirely the same reason why Mitt Romney only has an effective rax rate of about 13% despite the fact that his income falls in the 35% tax rate bracket. You CANNOT ignore these loopholes and deductions. It's naive. Whichever way you slice this thing, US ranks among the most forgiving nations in terms of corporate earnings.","c6ztb4j"

1. So imagine you're in prison and you work.  Eight hours a day.  That might get you one single minute or two of talk time because the pay is so low.  The other option is to have your family pay for it.  Personally, I'd much rather teach the lesson that if you want something you have to work for it, and set realistic goals for them.  You don't make your kid paint the house and mow the yard for a month for a single candy bar and walk away thinking you've successfully taught them the value of a dollar or humility or to not be selfish.  All you've done was get free labor for a minimum cost from a captive audience.  This is the entire goal of this phone fuckery.

2. So you've isolated them from their friends/family.  Humans are social creatures and will seek to be social.  If this cannot happen with the people they liked before, they'll find new people to like.  Now when they get out they have no friends/family to go back to, so they'll end up sticking together and likely reverting to their old ways because they have no where to go.

Prison is taken very seriously by almost everyone.  The issue is that the system is so screwed up that it actively encourages repeat offenders and throws people in jail for extended periods of time over stupid and minor things.  Get caught smoking a joint?  Off to jail!  Can't afford that $1600 speeding ticket you got for doing 2 over the speed limit in a double speeding fines zone that also happens to be in a construction site by a school?  Off to jail!  Your girlfriend gets mad at you and accuses you of beating her?  Off to jail!  Someone breaks into your house and you shoot them in the face?  Off to jail!  Some kid cuts through your yard on the way to school and twists their ankle in your yard?  Off to jail!

Jail, jail, jail.  Jail should only be reserved for serious repeat offenders of nonviolent crimes, or perpetrators of violent crimes.  30 days might not sound like a lot to the 'justice' system, but when it means you'll lose your job, pay thousands in fine, and will have your life fucked up, it is a pretty serious charge.","c77w4go"

You responded with rhetoric and no facts, and ignored my rebuttals. I asked you how you would implement your system. You responded with rhetoric, no facts.You said you would just tell people how they should behave and they would all magically see the wisdom and immediately completely change the entire legal and regulatory framework of the society towards a totally untested framework that you devised out of nothing.

You say that government is inherently totally evil and out of the control of the people, but you ignore the fact that the people have ultimate control of government and choose not to exercise it. You then used people's lack of interest in running their government to prove that they lacked the ability to do so.

You speak of a voluntaryist society that will change everything, but you have no way to get from here to there other than to ""explain the benefits"" to people. Yet you haven't specifically explained a single benefit or given me a single hard fact showing how your system would function more effectively than the current one. You just speak in rhetoric over and over again. When I ask you for specifics, you decline to give them, restate your vague generalities and then say I'm nitpicking and wasting your time for refusing to accept that. If this is your idea of explaining the benefits of your system, you have a lot of work to do.

My problem with you, and the reason I keep pushing this, is that you over and over again fail to support your assertions with anything other than your own assumptions. Assumptions which I do not share, and which don't appear to be grounded in fact. You talk about how people aren't responding to your logic, but I don't see logic. I see ungrounded assumptions that don't stand up to scrutiny and a snivelling child who is crying when somebody disagrees with him. I'll admit I'm being a bit of a dick about it, but the point still stands: You want everybody to agree with you, but you don't seem to have beliefs based in a real, grounded understanding of the world. You have a reactionary, unsupported philosophy, or at the very least you've declined to meaningfully support it. 

That's why I think you're probably a teenager. 21 at the oldest. Because the way you try to support your argument reeks of someone who doesn't understand why everybody doesn't just see his wisdom, and who also doesn't understand his own philosophy well enough to be able to support it. You might just be stupid, but I don't really think so. You seem like a smart person who thinks he's smarter than he is because he's used to being around comparative morons.

So show me some facts to support the need for your system, rather than restating your assumptions. Give me a meaningful and specific plan to get people to change the whole of society to your untested scheme. If you can't demonstrate that your system is necessary, you'll never convince people to change. And if you can't convince people to change even if your system would be an improvement, then your system is completely useless and you need to go back to the drawing board.

I want to be convinced, I really do. But I'm not just going to believe what you say, and neither is anybody else. You say you have the solution? SHOW YOUR FUCKING WORK OR SHUT UP.","c79n12c"

Currently the value of the Dollar is not where it was years ago and that sir is based partially on debt",-5,"echopeus",1356631481,0,-5,"t3_15inkl","c7muunk","False","Uh, he's right. We don't. Government debt can be rolled forward into perpetuity.

And even if for some reason we didn't want to do that, the debt can be eliminated without ""paying"" it off. Too many people don't understand that government debt is not like household debt. If a household takes a loan, they must eventually pay it back which requires a sacrifice of some wealth. Governments don't work like that (so long as they have economic sovereignty).

The fallacy that people maintain is that if we spend dollars today, we will have to sacrifice some real wealth in the future (like cutting back on services, or cancelling infrastructure projects) in order to ""pay it back"". But that's not true. *Dollars* have to be sacrificed in the future to pay back the debt, not wealth. And the supply of dollars is arbitrary and controlled by government.

When it comes to a household's spending, it's desirable to spend as much (or less than) you earn - which means you don't accrue debt. But for a government, that's a meaningless goal. A government wants to keep the economy healthy, which may require running a surplus or running a deficit or any point in between. But notably, the midpoint where the government spends as much as it earns is just as arbitrary as any other point on the scale, since the supply of dollars is arbitrary.","c7muunk"

But Christians (those that disagree with the lifestyle, I mean) need to learn to stop being so hateful. When Christ encountered someone that was in sin, He did not condemn or denounce that person, instead He treated that person with love. He made it clear that the person was in sin, but all in love, almost like He was saying ""I love you. You're sinning, but I love you, and nothing could ever change that. Now go and sin no more."" If a Christian that disagrees with the lifestyle encounters someone that is involved with the lifestyle, and the subject comes up, the Christian should not feel afraid of being honest about his/her beliefs as the other should not feel afraid of being honest about his/her beliefs with the Christian.

Nothing you say really refutes my hypothesis that the rich are much more likely to spend/invest their money overseas than the rest of us; or that corporations will do the same (though I agree that small companies are probably more likely to spend domestically - they also are more likely to be struggling right now than large companies).

In any case it puzzles me that this aspect of the 1%/99% dichotomy doesn't seem to get much attention.",1,"Lewsir",1353990811,0,1,"t3_13t221","c775l30","False","The reason you think that is because of hearing about large corporations on the news (especially during the election) and the issue of moving jobs overseas. I'm talking about the more local level, which is much more common. In reality, you local supermarket is not going to outsource jobs to china. However, say one is having trouble financially during the economic crisis, as many other supermarkets are as well--another chain will buy it out and keep those jobs from going away. However, this does create the problem of larger companies replacing smaller, local companies, but it's complicated. On one hand, you want those jobs, but on the other you don't want to have that smaller market disappear. It's very complicated and my economics class has not gone that deep, so I will leave it at that. In general though, going back to your statement about moving jobs overseas, it is something called globalization, and it's a result of companies being able to find cheaper labor overseas as well as improvements in technology which allows them to do so profitably. While many would argue that profit is bad and that companies are evil for maximizing profit, companies must maximize profit in order to keep the market forces working normally, and what those market forces are doing is forcing production out of the US because of the supply of labor.","c775l30"

* reduce the amount of troops in Afghanistan/reduce the DoD budget. As a prior service Army Infantry vet, with a little brother and friends still/currently serving in the INF., **no thanks**! Now my little brother's squad/platoon/company has to perform the same amount of work, the same missions, with **less people and less equipment**. It already wasn't going well!

It certainly leaves one wondering why NONE of the major media outlets bothered to drill into the specifics of the Simpson-Bowles plan before touting it as a credible fiscal model, INCLUDING MSNBC.  After all, why would one need to target government programs which DIDN'T create the nation's fiscal crisis OR the one segment of U.S. society (i.e., lower/middle class) with the least amount of financial resources to shoulder the nation's financial burdens in order to solve the nation's fiscal problems.  Yes, the solution ""pain"" must be shared in this country, but it should NOT be carried largely by those who have benefitted the LEAST from this society.

I wish I could say I'm surprised by the distinctly Conservative tilt of the Simpson-Bowles plan, but I can't.

Meanwhile I have yet to see any significant improvements to labs/classrooms nor any expansion of programs...nor any new hires for additional classes.

Granted there was a need for more dorms, as state schools are seeing an influx from those that can no longer afford private, however there is no doubt the money should have been spent elsewhere on a campus. For example we have few doubleup GEs/classes that overlap semesters, making graduation tracks very tight..then again maybe they are trying to extend graduation times for more tuition.

This also pushes established well liked profs to other places, because they don't want to spend the money on anything but adjunct..This of course places even more pressure on tenured profs. It is a vicious cycle.

I love pretty much all my profs, but the school will not see a dime from me as an alumni.

Here's how it would have played out if the situation had been reversed.

If all the polls would have showed Obama winning, but then he lost, these polls would be presented as evidence that the election was indeed somehow STOLEN.

(And there is plenty of other evidence that this is in fact probably true. [For example, Obama won many precincts in Philadelphia by receiving 99% of the vote](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2012/11/sounds-racist-obama-received-99-of-vote-in-inner-city-philly-precincts/). In some cases, he received 100% of the vote ... evidence of massive vote fraud on the part of Democrats.)

Since all the polls instead showed Romney fairing better ... of course, the conclusion by the New York Times is that all these polls were BIASED against Democrats. No way Obama stole the election, even though almost all of the pre-election polls showed he should have fared much, much worse than he actually did.","c6zo3et"

However, they also want their brand to be associated with reliability, and having someone point them out as among the least reliable polls was a blow to their marketing.

There is nothing to change, business-model-wise. They can do free polls out of their marketing budget, or they can sit back and let a competitor's name get out there instead.

Piston, by some stroke of luck, was 100% uninjured. While extremely startled and frightened, she eventually warmed up to all of us and became very cuddly and playful in the car. She is a precious animal and everyone in our family fell in love.

 

However, when taking her out of the car, she was extremely (and unexpectedly) startled by the garage door opening and bolted (my brother could only hold on so long. His cat scratch marks prove that). Poor Piston was terrified of this new environment, and was flying by the seat of her pants as she bolted around the neighborhood. We searched for half the night, to no avail.

 

**So the first way you can help:**

If anyone sees a cat in the Holland, MI area that looks like Piston, please give me a PM. We are searching desperately and cannot find her.

 

**The second way you can help:**

If anyone is missing a Russian Blue cat in the Rochester, MN area, we would love to get the cat back to it's original owner. While we love Piston, we would be devastated to lose one of our current pets, and we don't wish that feeling onto anyone. If Piston was abandoned or has no owner, we will take care of her if we find her. But that is only if we do not find her loving owners.

And we know: Hindsight is 20/20. We should've found a box at a store. We should've drove into the garage. We should've done this, that, etc... But all we care about is making sure this animal is ok.


**Edit:** Only a quick update since I'm so tired. No luck finding her today. Searched all day. BUT! We heard nearby meows. Food was taken from our doorstep. In all situations, Reddit has been so helpful getting the word out. I will keep you guys updated. I am committed to finding this cat! Thanks for the support, everyone :)","c7nx67w"

Welfare is important, because it grows the economy. When people use the system correctly, it works great. More money in peoples pockets means more spending, which means an increase in profits for the private sector, which means a better economy. Just because some people missuse the system, is not grounds for completely abolishing it. I will admit, it does need reformed, but not eliminated. Just a quick note, Bachman who is wealthy, abuses the welfare system by utilizing farm subsidies and tax breaks for the herd of children she has adopted. She does not need this money, but she sure does take it when offered. That is the fundamental problem: people using welfare when they don't need it.

The eyes are normally a lighter color (yellow or amber).  The head and nose are narrow, the body is generally longer and the legs are often longer.  The tail is often shorter (all when compared to a dog - husky, GSD).

But at some point, it has to be recognized that, realistically, one 'side' might not be a side at all. It might be like someone arguing about how to save the fish in a fish tank. One 'side' says to pull them all out with a net, throw some chlorine in the water, and put the fish back. The other side might suggest an algae cleaning, and maybe implementing a fellow algae eating fish that gets along with the others.

Just because there are two 'sides' doesn't mean that the second side is 'one-sided'. One side is so out of touch with reality, and gets away with so much bullshit (MORE than the other, not like they are both innocent) that it's silly.

There aren't two legitimate sides to every issue. Sometimes, you have to call bullshit what it is.

Bush tax cuts raised revenue and had nothing to do with the sub prime mortgage crisis that the dems pushed through nor any deregulation issues. That was all congress related. (Many repubs were on board but it was led by dem controlled congress) People making larger profits by investing larger portions of money kept, ultimately paying more dollars to the government is not and cannot be a cause for a recession. Seriously one of the weakest arguments from the left at the moment. I can't believe they still push it whenever they get a chance since it has been debunked over and over and over again. 

Obama changed the Bush plan to wind down involvement in the middle east. Sent more troops (granted, the military asked for it) and started more conflicts. 

reducing a DEFICIT is nothing to be proud of. Reducing the DEBT is. Which Obama has come no where even close to it. (Which actually isn't his fault, I'll explain more later) Just because they aren't spending as much borrowed money as he was when he first started is nothing to be proud of. The fact that you just tried to use that as a positive point in his favor is shocking. That's like MediaMatters/ThinkProgress/HuffPo levels of shocking. Those are ridiculous biased sources and often inaccurate/not the full story. I am only assuming those are your sources but it would make sense based on the quality and subject of your arguments. 

&gt; If you think the events and policies of previous years don't impact the reality of the present, then YOU need to get better sources of information.

Strawman, that is not what I am saying. I clearly stated that since it continued his entire term, Obama holds responsibility for it. You know who else agrees with that? Obama. 

&gt;Join us in the real world, will you?

You know we've had bubbles burst before, right? Bush's (and now Obama's) big government controlled economies caused this. Poor regulation, poor incentives for sub prime mortgages, and excessive debt were the main causes. Note, these were DEMOCRATS that pushed that through their congress. The president has very little impact either way. Bush isn't to blame, Obama isn't to blame. (Other than the military involvment, they get the blame for that)

Seriously though, I'd take a hard look at your sources. There is a LOT of bad information floating around on reddit. These democrats and their economic theories are absolutely insane.

First, they start with Hoover and FDR. Note the stark contrast. FDR obviously brought us out of the Great Depression and Hoover did not, but this one switch accounts for most of this effect.

We can't find similar pairings after that that make us conclude Democrats are better for the economy. All we're seeing after that is the general arc of history - after WWII, Truman does okay, but his economy is hampered by the Korean War. Then things really pick up under Eisenhower, continue to thrive under JFK and LBJ, but there's no real difference in policy that we can point to between these administrations; things were more or less going fine until the 70s, when inflation began to be a problem. This ruins things for Nixon, Ford, and Carter, and it's not until Reagan (and Paul Volcker) that we start to see a correction, and the economy picks up again. Things stutter late in Reagan's term and under H.W. Bush thanks to the S&amp;L crisis, but this largely gets sorted out by the time Clinton is in office, in time to take advantage of the post-Soviet era and the arrival of the Internet. Clinton does really well, but he leaves office just as the stock bubble that drove a lot of his economic successes is deflating, and saddles George W. Bush with the result. Bush screws the pooch, of course, but he's not uniquely to blame for everything that happens during his term, just as Clinton isn't responsible for all the success of his term.

Finally, this leaves off Obama; I'm not sure what effect he would have had on this chart, but I'm guessing it wasn't flattering.

So what can we conclude?

* FDR was awesome.
* Hoover really sucked.
* Keynesian economics (as practiced by both parties) really worked well until about the 70s.

TL;DR. Shut up.",-3,"kyesac90",1356060440,0,-3,"t3_1563s9","c7jpb84","False","I'm going to post this every time I see a sugar glider thread, because in every one, people talk about wanting to get one.

First, you need to get them in a pair. They will get depressed and lonely if they are by themselves. It doesn't matter how much time you're able to spend with them, they'll still get lonely. (Of course there are always exceptions.)

Sugar gliders are nocturnal animals, meaning they're awake at night, and sleep during the day. FAR from ideal for most people. That doesn't mean you can go ahead and keep them awake all day because you want to play with them, because they can just sleep at night when you do.

The biggest thing about them is their smell. As much reading as I did before I bought my pair, I wasn't prepared for just how badly the smelled. They smell terribly. They have a natural smell about them (which isn't great) and their piss also smells terribly. Breeders suggest a wire cage that is taller than wide, so that they can climb around it when they're awake. That means they will be against the side of the cage, and piss and shit OUTSIDE of the cage, onto the wall, the floor, or whatever else is near their cage. They are also extremely messy eaters, which means fresh fruit outside your cage, also. The breeder I got mine from suggested I never wear good clothes when I have them on me, because, well, they will piss and shit on you, too. Sure, there are ways around these problems, like building a guard around the cage, and cleaning the cage daily, but for the average person, this won't happen.

Also, they take quite a while for them to get used to you. I took a chair, and sat it in front of their cage for hours every night with just my arm in there for them to explore me, and get used to my smells. Then you can start letting them climb around on you, and finally they will get attached, but that is a long time down the line. Again, patience will solve this.

Their diet is also pretty complex. I bought a specialty food for them that I gave daily, along with fresh fruit. That means cutting it up every day for them, and switching it up daily so they got all different types of nutrition. Also, they love mealworms. Live mealworms. So I kept a cage filled with 500 live mealworms in my refrigerator at all times for them. I also had to show them how to eat mealworms, which meant cutting them open and squishing out their guts so they realized they could eat them.

All in all, for the average pet owner, sugar gliders are NOT a pet to own. Sure, they look adorable as hell, and they are, but I can't stress enough to just admire them in pictures, or a zoo. They are a lot of work for the reward at the end.

TL;DR: If you couldn't be bothered to read this post, you're definitely the type of person who should never own a sugar glider.

The United States has a huge population yes, but huge population of elderly people who are no longer making any revenue and simply living off savings.

Then we have a population of the younger generation who could be paying for health care except they don't have the jobs. Even if they did, many opt to not have health coverage because they feel they don't need it and that probably is true. 

Unfortunately health insurance programs, and in this case the government, cannot function this way because older generation needs health care bill to be paid off by the younger generation as they aren't earning money and what money they do earn does not pay for how much money they require in medical expenses.

You'd have to round up all the corporate officers, all the shareholders, the bondholders, and maybe even the employees in one indictment in order to sue a corporation, because only people can be sued in courts, and corporations by your argument aren't people.

We don't lose our rights when we form corporations. If I can speak, and you can speak and our 30 friends can speak, why is it when we form a corporation, we suddenly cannot speak freely? If I can refuse to spend money on contraception, and you can, and our 30 friends all can, then why is it that when we form a corporation, we suddenly become criminals for refusing to give our employees contraception? So I'm not in line with corporations aren't people. Groups of people possess the same rights as each individual.

This entire idea of ""employee benefits"" evolved because we have a terrible tax system. Politicians have confused ""X is good"" with ""we must subsidize X so everyone has it"". For tax reasons, it's cheaper for companies to provide pensions rather than give their employees a higher salary and tell them to invest for retirement themselves. It's cheaper to give health care benefits rather than pay employees to buy their own health benefits. If corporations were paying their employees only in cash/stock, this would be a non-issue. Employees could buy their own contraception.

&gt;Of course a company has to provide retirement and pensions and minimum wages and health benefits (to eligible employees) and equality, and so on and so forth. Companies are not people. They have to maintain certain standards established by the government of the country they are working in, regardless of the religious beliefs of its owners. Anything else would be absolute madness.

Try starting a company and treating your employees like shit. Refuse to give them health care. Work them to the bone. Pay minimum wage and not a penny more. Fuck retirement savings: they can live off Social Security. Fire the women. And for good measure, you can refuse to promote any blacks, because you're racist. In sum, you're a shitty racist, asshole employer. Your company will fail because it can't retain talent; the employees are treated like slaves, so they will create products reflecting the quality of slave labor. It's not to the advantage of a company to fuck over their employees. It's not a fight between capital and labor: the best companies have both cooperating.
